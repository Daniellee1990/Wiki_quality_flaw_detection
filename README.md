# Wiki_quality_flaw_detection

This is the model for detection of wiki article quality flaw. We use the merged model to replace the traditional method, which mainly focus on using statistics features and machine learning models to find the quality flaw of the target wiki article.

In this model, we used Bert to extract semantic features from pages, and merge the features with traditional features. In order to find the best method to detect article quality flaw.
